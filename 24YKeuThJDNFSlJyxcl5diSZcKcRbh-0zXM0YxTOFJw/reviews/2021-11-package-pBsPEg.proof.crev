  atty is a micro-crate with little code and no dependency.
  The code looks fine to me. Complicated just because of multi-platform support.
  I trust it.
    
  malicious potential: 0%  
  dependencies:libc, winapi, hermit-abi
  unsafe:6 (because working with low level system calls)
  NONE: FFI, asm!, file-read, file-write, no_mangle, network-access, build.rs, proc_macro, process::command, macro_rules

  A library to compile C/C++/assembly into a Rust library/application.
  
  
  I trust the author. I didn't review the source code.
