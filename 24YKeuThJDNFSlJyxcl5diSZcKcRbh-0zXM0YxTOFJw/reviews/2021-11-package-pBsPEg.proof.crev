  bitflags code is a big macro. no dependency.
  It looks basic and low. It has a lot of contributors.
  I trust them to spot any strangeness.
    
  malicious potential: 0%  
  build.rs: just check the rustc_minor_version
  dependencies:0
  macro_rules:6 (that is the point of the crate)
  NONE: unsafe, FFI, asm!, file-read, file-write, no_mangle, network-access, proc_macro, process::command,
