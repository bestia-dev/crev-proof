  I am the author of this crate.  
  wsl_open_browser just opens the browser from inside WSL2.  
  The trick is, that it transforms file path from Linux to Windows notation.  
  Very useful for `cargo doc --open`.

  Adds the trait `VerboseUnwrap` to `Result` and `Option`.  
  Adds the macro `unwrap!` that writes the filename, line and column of the position in code where the panic happened. Very useful.  
  Because the original `unwrap()` in wasm returns totally unuseful location inside licore ?!?!: `panicked at... src/libcore/option.rs:378:21`.

  BASIC LIBRARY
  
  wasm-bindgen-test is the absolute basic core crate for rust + wasm.
  I trust it just like I trust the Rust standard library or the rust compiler.
  I didn't review the source code.
