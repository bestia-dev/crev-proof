  Adds the trait `VerboseUnwrap` to `Result` and `Option`.  
  Adds the macro `unwrap!` that writes the filename, line and column of the  
  position in code where the panic happened. Very useful.  
  Because the original `unwrap()` in wasm returns totally unuseful location inside licore ?!?!: `panicked at... src/libcore/option.rs:378:21`.
